## Lua++ VM
The current folder contains all of the contents of the runtime executable (```luappvm```). The VM has been designed to use little to no external dependencies making it as compact and fast as possible. If some of this code is not completely readable to you, I apologize as cleanliness was not my priority when writing this codebase.

### Runnning the VM
To run the vm use the following command:
```
./bin/luappvm input.bin
```
