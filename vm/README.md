## Lua++ VM
The current folder contains all of the contents of the runtime executable (```luappvm```). The VM has been designed to use little to no external dependencies making it as compact and efficient as possible. I apologize for any illegible or messy code, I still need to revise much of it.

### Runnning the VM
To run the vm use the following command:
```
./bin/luappvm input.bin
```
