# Lua++ programming language
This is the Lua++ C lang build, currently private but will soon be public. This codebase is not specifically tweaked to a certain compiler, so any C/C++ compiler should be able to build this project easily. Personally, I recommend building it with ```gcc``` although ```clang``` or ```MSVSC``` would also work fine.
